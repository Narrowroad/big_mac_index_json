# Big Mac Index in JSON

I wanted to build an assignment for students learning how to use APIs in React that compared not only currency exchange rates but also purchasing power. It might not be perfect, but [The Economist's bi-annual Big Mac Index](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index) certainly helps understand economic concepts.

The only problem is it's not in an easily digestible format for web development. Since I went to the trouble of converting it to JSON, I thought I would make my conversions available to others as well.

Check out [The Economist's Big Mac Index site](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index) for more information on the project and the concepts of purchasing power and currency valuations.

## Data

Each file contains all of the data for one release date. The object contains a field for the release date in `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601) format. Note that the release dates provided are only month and year, so I added `01` for the day.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Simple follow the same pattern for the previous files by release date.

## Warranty

**This data comes with no warranty.**
