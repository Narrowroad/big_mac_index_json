# Big Mac Index in JSON

I wanted to build an assignment for students learning how to use APIs in React that compared not only currency exchange rates but also purchasing power. It might not be perfect, but [The Economist's bi-annual Big Mac Index](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index) certainly helps understand economic concepts.

The only problem was it was not in an easily digestible format for web development. Since I went to the trouble of converting it to JSON, I thought I would open it up for others as well.

Check out [The Economist's Big Mac Index site](http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index) for more information on the project and the concepts purchasing power and currency valuations.
